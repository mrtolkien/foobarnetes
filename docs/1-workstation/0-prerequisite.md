# Prerequisite

## Workstation

Your workstation is the client PC that you will use to manage the kubernetes cluster.

## Operating system

As we will be relying on a lot of Unix commands, the whole tutorial assumes you are using Linux or MacOS.

If you are on Windows, you can use [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) to get access to a Linux enviroment.

## Brew

[Brew](https://brew.sh/) is a great package manager that works on both Linux and Mac OS. It will allow us to automatically install all our required dependencies.

If you have not installed it yet, you can use the following install script:

```shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
